Back in 2017 a [nudge from Daz](/2017/03/26/daz-made-me-do-it.html) got me started on this whole blogging adventure, and up it went on Wordpress. It's what I was familiar with at the time and it got me up and running quickly.

Now, almost 10 years later, I've decided to join the cool kids, moving the whole lot to GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I even bought a domain!

Thanks [Graham](https://grahamrpugh.com) for giving me a push in the right direction; I couldn't take Wordpress's ads or glacial performance anymore either.

All the posts are moved over and I'll be tweaking over the coming weeks as I get more in depth with Jekyll. Thanks for bearing with it as things are a little rough around the edges.

I think I need a comments thingy next...
