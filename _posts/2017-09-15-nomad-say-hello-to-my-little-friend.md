At yesterday evening's [London Apple Admins](http://www.londonappleadmins.org.uk/) meetup I spoke about [NoMAD](https://nomad.menu/) and the goodness it brings to our environment. Thanks again to Louis Treger (@tregerl on Slack) and [MullenLowe](http://www.mullenlowelondon.com/) for hosting us in their lovely offices and thanks to [Amsys](http://www.amsys.co.uk/) for providing copious amounts of food and drink for the event!
