London Apple Admins are meeting this evening with a line up of great speakers, kindly hosted by ITV this time. Unfortunately, due to family circumstances, I can't attend tonight, but I'll be catching as much of the live stream as I can. And so should you, if you're interested! Click the link below and enjoy!
