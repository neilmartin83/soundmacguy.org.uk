Session videos from this year's Jamf Nation User Conference are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JAMFMedia/videos). I was there(!) and had the honour and pleasure of presenting alongside [Tristan Valente](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/tristan-valente-49628990) of [Netopie](https://netopie.com/).

Our session explored the novel approach of managing your Jamf Pro instance using [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) methodologies. We introduced the concepts of [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) for version control and change management/review as well as taking a deeper look at [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) and the [Deployment Theory](https://github.com/deploymenttheory) [jamfpro](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-jamfpro) provider, the tools that make the magic happen.

The Jamf Blog also published [this article](https://www.jamf.com/blog/automate-apple-endpoints-terraform-gitlab-cicd-jamf-pro) about the session.
