If you've ever been unfortunate enough to stumble into the #london channel on the [MacAdmins Slack](https://macadmins.herokuapp.com/), you may see something like this in the early Greenwich Mean Time hours:

For most uninitiated non-Brits, you'll be forgiven for thinking it's some kind of secret code or cult ritual (actually, maybe it is), so let's de-mistify things.<!--more-->

The man in the picture is Officer Crabtree (played by Arthur Bostrom), a character from British 1980's sit-com ['Allo 'Allo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Allo_%27Allo!), set in wartime France. There are characters from France, Britain, Germany and other countries. The programme uses the device of representing each language with English spoken in a theatrical foreign accent.

Crabtree is an Englishman, but has the job of a French policeman, who comically cannot speak French. This is reflected in his accent, especially when he enters a scene to say "Good morning", but instead says "Good moaning!". This has since become a catchphrase in British culture (because hey, we like to moan!). His other mispronunciations often have a tone of innuendo.

To truly appreciate it, you have to see (and hear) it - so check out this video where you'll either revel in laughter or be perplexed in misunderstanding:

So, what are you waiting for? Pop into #london and use the **:goodmoaning:** custom emoji yourself!

P.s. On Friday moanings, things sometimes take an interesting twist...
