Apple have updated the following articles:

**Create a NetBoot, NetInstall, or NetRestore image:** [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202770](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202770)

**Mac startup key combinations:** [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201255](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201255)

The following parts stick out in particular:

...and...

I believe NetBoot is no longer possible on an iMac Pro, even if you disable Secure Boot, as outlined here: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330) - I haven't actually got an iMac Pro to test this on, so if anyone could confirm, that would be fantastic. I'm also not sure if **Internet Recovery** ([https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204904](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204904) and [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201314](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201314)) works, but assume it does as Apple haven't updated those articles (yet).

The 2.6 release of Configurator adds functionality to recover iMac Pros, in a similar fashion to a DFU restore on iOS devices: [https://help.apple.com/configurator/mac/2.6/#/apdebea5be51](https://help.apple.com/configurator/mac/2.6/#/apdebea5be51)

It'll be interesting to see what happens with the next round of Mac releases... interesting times indeed...
