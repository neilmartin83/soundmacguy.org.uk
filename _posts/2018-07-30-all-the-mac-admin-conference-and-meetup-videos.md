Whilst perusing the [Slack](https://macadmins.herokuapp.com/), as you do, a post from @matx (organiser of [MacDevOpsYVR](https://mdoyvr.com/)) stuck out where he listed a bunch of links to various Mac/Apple Admin conference videos.

To my surprise, I couldn't find much in terms of an aggregated listing online (probably more to do with my rubbish search skills), so I set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/neilmartin83/all-the-macadmin-conference-videos), listing conference video feeds/pages, as well as those from local meetups - which don't get as much exposure and can be a great source of hidden gems.

It's nothing fancy, just a Readme.md page.

Fill your boots (and brains).

See something wrong or missing? That's why it's on GitHub - so the community can make it better. Do kindly send a pull request! :-)
