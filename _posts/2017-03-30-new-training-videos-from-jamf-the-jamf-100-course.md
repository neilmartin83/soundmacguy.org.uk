Jamf just put a bunch of interesting introductory training videos up. As well as covering the basics of the Jamf Pro product, there are also some nice little nuggets that are more general.

I particularly liked the CLI and Scripting lessons. From a pedagogical (teaching methodology) perspective, I think they're really well presented and paced. If you're new to the macOS command line, or just want to refresh your existing knowledge, it's worth a look.
