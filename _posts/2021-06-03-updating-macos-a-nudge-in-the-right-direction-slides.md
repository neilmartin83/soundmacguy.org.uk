I was stoked to present at the 2021 [Penn State University MacAdmins Campfire sessions](https://macadmins.psu.edu/) today!

After reviewing current methods of installing macOS software updates (softwareupdate, MDM commands and configuration profiles) and exploring their limitations the bulk of this presentation focused on how to deploy and configure [Nudge](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge); a utility written by [Erik Gomez](https://blog.eriknicolasgomez.com/) that persistently guides users to the System Preferences Software Update pane with varying levels of “persuasion”.

Thank you to everyone who attended and special thanks to the people at Penn State for organising the event!
