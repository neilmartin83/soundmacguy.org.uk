I'm finally getting around to using [GitHub](https://github.com/neilmartin83/) properly, instead of randomly putting things up on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/neilmartin83).

I've kicked things off by creating a repo containing a lot of the custom configuration profiles I push to the Macs I manage. I'll be documenting them properly in the [README](https://github.com/neilmartin83/configuration_profiles/blob/master/README.md) in the near future. Maybe they'll be useful to other folks.

[Click here to go to the repo](https://github.com/neilmartin83/configuration_profiles/)!

A lot of them focus on suppressing welcome/first run screens and disabling automatic updating for the apps they manage (because Mac Labs). There are some that do bespoke stuff as well, such as [Logic Pro](https://github.com/neilmartin83/configuration_profiles/blob/master/Apple%20Logic%20Pro%20X.mobileconfig) (probably worthy of its own post here, eventually).

I'll also be moving various scripts and Jamf Pro Extension Attributes over to it.
