A small company, [dataJAR](https://datajar.co.uk/), run by a couple of my friends, [Ben](https://macmule.com/) and James, has been facing legal action by DTAG (owners of T-Mobile) because they think they own the perception of a particular combination of wavelengths of light.

DTAG or T-Mobile or whoever you are, if you read this, I think you'd do well to follow [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com/).
