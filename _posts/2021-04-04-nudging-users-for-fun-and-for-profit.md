[At last Thursday's London Apple Admins meet-up (April 1st)](https://londonappleadmins.org.uk/2021/04/01/watch-the-video-1st-april-2021-remote-meetup/), I did a short presentation and demo on the awesome utility [Nudge](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge), written by [Erik Gomez](https://blog.eriknicolasgomez.com/). Grab a copy of the slides [here](https://londonappleadmins.org.uk/presentations/2021.04.01-LDNApplAdminsNeil.pdf) and watch the video below:

Thanks to everyone who joined the meet-up to watch the talks and to all the other speakers. It was one of the most jam-packed London Apple Admins yet (let's hope the next one is in person as lockdown eases across the UK - I really miss you all)! Also, be sure to check out [Erik's talk on Nudge](https://blog.eriknicolasgomez.com/2021/03/30/Nudge-Swift-Texas-macadmins-presentation/) that he did on the 30th of March for Texas Apple Admins.
