If you're working with the Apple School and Business Manager APIs, you know how powerful, but also how complex, they can be to get started with. To make life easier, I’ve put together a public Postman collection that gives you a head start.

[Click here to grab it!](https://www.postman.com/neilmartin-6501015/apple-school-and-business-manager-api/collection/tss0hiz/apple-school-and-business-manager-api?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=44709244)

You'll need an Access Token to authenticate any live requests you want to make. Learn how to generate one here: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-school-and-business-manager-api/implementing-oauth-for-the-apple-school-and-business-manager-api](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-school-and-business-manager-api/implementing-oauth-for-the-apple-school-and-business-manager-api)

Use Bart's handy ZSH script: [https://bartreardon.github.io/2025/06/11/using-the-new-api-for-apple-business-school-manager.html](https://bartreardon.github.io/2025/06/11/using-the-new-api-for-apple-business-school-manager.html)

Or go further with Anthony's workflow: [https://cantscript.com/posts/automating-token-generation-for-apple-school-managers-new-api/](https://cantscript.com/posts/automating-token-generation-for-apple-school-managers-new-api/)

I’ll continue to expand it as Apple updates the API. If you find it useful or have suggestions, feel free to fork, contribute, or reach out.

Happy building!
