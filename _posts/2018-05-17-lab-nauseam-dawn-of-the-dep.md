Today, I presented at the Jamf Nation Roadshow in London. My talk focused on the trials and tribulations of integrating an installation based, DEP workflow into a lab environment leveraging [DEPNotify](https://gitlab.com/Mactroll/DEPNotify) and some exiting new/in-development user input functionality.

Bits and pieces from my presentation are all in this lovely GitHub repo: [https://github.com/neilmartin83/Jamf-Nation-Roadshow-London-2018](https://github.com/neilmartin83/Jamf-Nation-Roadshow-London-2018)

There, you'll find a more in-depth technical explanation with links to further resources and an example script to trawl through.

If you just want the slides, you can download them [here.](https://github.com/neilmartin83/Jamf-Nation-Roadshow-London-2018/raw/master/JNRS%202018%20-%20Dawn%20of%20the%20DEP%20-%20Neil%20Martin.pdf)
