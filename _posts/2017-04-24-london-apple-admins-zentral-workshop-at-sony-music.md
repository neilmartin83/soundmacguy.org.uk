We had a [London Apple Admins](http://www.londonappleadmins.org.uk) meet up at Sony Music [last Thursday](http://www.londonappleadmins.org.uk/events/20th-april-2017-meetup-sony-music-london/)! As one of the resident 'herders' (along with [Ben](https://macmule.com), [Darren](http://www.amsys.co.uk/author/daz_wallace/), [Graham](http://grahamgilbert.com/) and [Steve](https://blog.quirke.org/)), I'm honoured to share the video of this event, which includes a workshop on [Zentral](https://zentral.io), an open source framework for monitoring stuff.

Huge thanks to Ross Drummond at Sony for hosting us and for putting on an awesome spread of fine beverages and pizza. Thanks also to Henry Stamerjohann at Zentral for his most informative workshop. There were much learnings to be had!

If you'd like to host a future meet up or present at one, we'd love to hear from you! [Give us a shout](http://www.londonappleadmins.org.uk/about/).
