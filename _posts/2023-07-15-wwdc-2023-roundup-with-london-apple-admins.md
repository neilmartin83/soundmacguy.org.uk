title: "WWDC 2023 Roundup with London Apple Admins"

Thursday the 13th of July was the 33rd [London Apple Admins](https://londonappleadmins.org.uk/) event (holy crap I've never counted before!). I was honoured to commandeer a speaker slot and deliver my take on some of the announcements following the 2023 [Worldwide Developer's Conference](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/).

It was also the first time in over 3 years (I think) that all 5 of the organisers ([Ben](https://macmule.com/), [Daz](https://dazwallace.wordpress.com/), [Graham](https://grahamgilbert.com/), [Steve](https://blog.quirke.org/) and I) were together in person.

Please do check out the video below for our somewhat unique perspective on WWDC 2023 (and enjoy the first part where things didn't exactly go to plan!). This meet had a gaggle of fantastic talks from the LAA crew; Steve, Darren and Ben!
