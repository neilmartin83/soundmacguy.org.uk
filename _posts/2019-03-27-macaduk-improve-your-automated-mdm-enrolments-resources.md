I was lucky enough to share the stage with [Joel Rennich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-rennich-5853a0b7) at this year's [Apple Admin and Developer Conference UK](https://www.macad.uk/). We spoke about how to achieve more automation and improve the ways we get Macs enrolled into our MDM solutions. The icing on the cake was a deep dive into some new functionality baked into [NoMAD Login AD](https://gitlab.com/orchardandgrove-oss/NoMADLogin-AD) with the release of version 1.3.0.

I hope you enjoyed yourself and got something useful to take away. Thanks to the conference organisers and Joel for a great time! :-)
