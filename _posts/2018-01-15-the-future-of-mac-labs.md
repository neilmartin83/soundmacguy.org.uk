This weekend, I was invited to join the lovely folks on the [MacAdmins Podcast](https://podcast.macadmins.org/) to share my pontifications on the subject of labs and their future. The Mac platform is undergoing the most amount of change I’ve ever seen in my career. The ramifications for provisioning Macs in this specific and rather niche setting are profound.

Thank you so much to the folks at the podcast – it was a real honour and privilege to have a chin-wag with you!
